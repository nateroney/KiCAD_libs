KiCAD_libs
==========

A library of components and footprints I've created for use with KiCAD.


natelib.lib (components for use in eeschema):
+ BLE112-A
+ LSM303DLM
+ TLV1117LVXX
+ TXB0102
+ LD1117S18
+ USB_MINIB

natelib.mod (modules for use in pcbnew):
+ BLE112-A
+ USB_MINIB

My best efforts have been made to ensure that the items in this library are correct, but there are likely some errors. Please double check your parts against actual-size printouts before using them for any production purpose.

To create a printout for test purposes, open _pcbnew_, select Module Editor, load the component, then click print. Select 'Scale 1' for the scale to create a 1:1 printout.
